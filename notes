- with the change of hitbox/sprite size, once it changes back the player might be within a boundary
		- Player::updateHitBox() in player.cpp
		- Also now having issues with walking right into a boundary box on the edges of the test bg

- fix menu responsiveness
		- splashMenu.cpp
		- also the menu .png's are too big to see the pointer so we need pointer animation and new menus

- there is no map 2 so for now, if it is selected, the core is dumped

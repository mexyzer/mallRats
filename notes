Tim:
- with the change of hitbox/sprite size, once it changes back the player might be within a boundary
		- Player::updateHitBox() in player.cpp
			- This is not an issue for now as the hitbox size doesn't change b/c the textures are all the same size

- fix menu responsiveness
		- splashMenu.cpp
		- also the menu .png's are too big to see the pointer so we need pointer animation and new menus

- there is no map 2 so for now, if it is selected, the core is dumped


- I just added a simple active/dead zone scrolling feature in the main loop
		- This must be altered for more general accuracy as it is still just a test

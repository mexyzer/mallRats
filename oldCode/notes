Tim:
- With the change of hitbox/sprite size, once it changes back the player might be within a 
  boundary
		- Player::updateHitBox() in player.cpp
			- This is not an issue for now as the hitbox size doesn't change b/c the textures 
			  are all the same size

- Fix menu responsiveness
		- splashMenu.cpp
		- as of now the menu has a delay for input so that it doesn't spaz out
		- also the menu .png's are too big to see the pointer so we need pointer animation and new menus

- There is no map 2 so for now, if it is selected, the core is dumped


- I have added a simple active/dead zone scrolling feature using a function
		- This function is in main.cpp -> deadZoneView() it basically moves the camera (or not
		  if it is in the 'dead zone'

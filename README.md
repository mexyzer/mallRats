# mallRats

Welcome to the project that began a long time ago in the mind of my father. This is the first attempt to realize a video game concept called MallRats. The overall theme of the game involves a character trying to obtain items from a shopping list that was given to him by his mother. The character travels to a mall where the entire game is set.

# Code/Design

The code is written in C++ using SFML to render "graphics". That term is used loosely as this iteration of the project uses .png files as textures that are simply rendered in succession to simulate animation.
